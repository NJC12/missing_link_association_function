Instructions:
1. Finding candidate peaks per chromatin mark per tissue type:

python3 find_candidate_peaks.py input.narrowPeak causativeGenes.bed step1.candidatePeak

2. Recenter and overlap per chromatin mark per tissue type:

./recenterNoverlap.sh step1.candidatePeak chr_sizes blacklist-hg19.bed step2.recenteredPeak

3. Find common chromatin peaks between DNase, H3K27AC, H3K4me1, and H3K4me3 peaks per tissue type

./findCommonPeaks.sh dnase.recenteredPeak ac.recenteredPeak me1.recenteredPeak me3.recenteredPeak step3.mergedPeak

4. Compute activity by distance per tissue type:

python3 abd-compute.py step3.mergedPeak reFlat.gencode.v19 output
